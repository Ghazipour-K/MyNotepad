# MyNotepad
MyNotepad is a windows desktop application which is almost like MS notepad in term of UI & features...
But in addition I tried to add more features to make it more usefull; Features like Save as PDF to save current document in PDF format,
Open URL to load an online txt file or any text base files like webpage into editor,
Line indicator sidebar to know and select lines of document, etc.
Why this app is developed? Well, my goal was to meet various C# & .Net app development chalenges and to use C#'s feaures the best way.
This app is a good point for those C# programmers who know the basics and want to start creating and developing real world applicatons.
